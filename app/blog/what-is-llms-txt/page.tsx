              <p>
                The llms.txt standard was proposed by <strong className="text-white">Jeremy Howard and the Answer.AI team in September 2024</strong>. The core problem they identified: as AI language models became the primary interface for web content discovery, websites had no way to provide structured, LLM-friendly navigation guidance. robots.txt tells crawlers what not to read. sitemap.xml tells crawlers what URLs exist. But nothing told AI systems <em>how to make sense of a website&apos;s content architecture</em>.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                The llms.txt proposal was immediately well-received by the AI community. Within months of its release, major technology organizations had implemented it — including:

                ))}
              </div>
              <p className="mt-5">
                As of 2026, llms.txt is not yet an official IETF or W3C standard — but it has reached sufficient industry adoption that major AI platforms treat it as a recognized content guidance signal.

                {[
                  { q: 'What is llms.txt?', a: 'llms.txt is an emerging standard file at yourdomain.com/llms.txt that gives AI language models a structured navigation guide to your website content — who you are, what pages exist, and what each covers. Think of it as a sitemap for AI models.' },
                  { q: 'How is llms.txt different from robots.txt?', a: 'robots.txt controls what crawlers cannot access. llms.txt guides AI models on what to prioritize and how to understand your site. They are complementary — robots.txt is access control, llms.txt is content navigation.' },
                  { q: 'Do I need llms.txt if I already have a sitemap.xml?', a: 'Yes. sitemap.xml lists URLs for search engine bots. llms.txt provides contextual descriptions and priority guidance for AI language models. Both serve different audiences and should both be present.' },
                  { q: 'Who created the llms.txt standard?', a: 'The llms.txt standard was proposed by Jeremy Howard and Answer.AI in September 2024. It has since been adopted by Cloudflare, Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere, and thousands of individual websites.' },
                  { q: 'Does llms.txt actually improve AI search visibility?', a: 'Yes — in two ways. It provides direct guidance during AI retrieval, helping models find your most relevant pages. And it signals technical AI-readiness, contributing to overall E-E-A-T credibility signals.' },
