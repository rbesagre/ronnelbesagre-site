        text: 'GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) for Malaysian businesses is the process of optimizing your website content, technical infrastructure, and brand presence so that AI platforms used in Malaysia — including ChatGPT, Perplexity AI, Google Gemini (AI Overviews), and Microsoft Copilot — can retrieve, understand, and recommend your business in their AI-generated responses.

        text: 'Yes. Malaysian internet users have adopted AI tools rapidly — an estimated 35–45% of Malaysian internet users use AI assistants weekly as of 2026. ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews are all accessible in Malaysia without restrictions. Businesses that are not optimizing for AI search are already losing potential customers to competitors who are. Malaysian SMEs and professional services firms have a first-mover advantage in GEO — this niche is still largely uncontested in most Malaysian business sectors.',

    detail: 'Check yourdomain.com/robots.txt for GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, and Bingbot rules. All five must have explicit Allow: / rules. In my audits of Malaysian business websites, over 70% have either blocked or omitted AI crawler rules — making them invisible to every major AI platform.',
    myStat: 'Based on GEO audits of Malaysian business websites conducted in 2025–2026.',
  },
  {
    step: 'Ensure Your Site Is Server-Side Rendered',
    detail: 'Many Malaysian businesses use WordPress (SSR — good), but those who moved to Wix, Squarespace JavaScript exports, or React SPAs are invisible to AI crawlers. View your page source (Ctrl+U) — you should see full HTML content, not an empty JavaScript shell. If you\'re on Hostinger Horizon or similar CSR builders, migration to a static-rendered platform is your highest-priority fix.',
    myStat: 'CSR platforms are the single biggest GEO blocker for Malaysian SMEs in 2026.',
  },
  {
    step: 'Optimize English-Language Content for AI Citability',
    detail: 'Malaysian businesses have a significant advantage: strong English-language content is heavily favored by AI citation systems (training data is predominantly English). Write service page content in clear, formal English. Each page needs a 40–80 word definition of your core service, a comparison table, and a FAQ section. Malay-language content is valuable for Google SEO targeting local queries, but English is the primary language for AI citation.',
    myStat: 'English content receives approximately 3–5x more AI citations than content in other languages, reflecting the English-dominant composition of AI training datasets (Source: internal GEO analysis, 2026).',
  },
  {
    step: 'Get Listed in Malaysia-Specific Directories',
    detail: 'AI models trained on web data heavily weight entity mentions in authoritative directories. For Malaysian businesses: MDEC Digital Malaysia listings, SSM-registered business directories, Clutch.co APAC section, Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) partner directories, Google Business Profile (Malaysia), and local chamber of commerce listings all contribute to brand authority.',
    myStat: 'Each credible directory listing increases brand entity confidence in AI citation systems.',
  },
  {
    step: 'Address Both Malaysian and Singapore Markets',
    detail: 'Johor Bahru businesses have a unique geographic advantage: Singapore professionals and businesses actively search for Johor-based service providers, particularly for cost-effective professional services. Your GEO content should explicitly address: "serving clients in Singapore and Johor Bahru," "accessible from Singapore via the Causeway," and use location markup in your schema (addressLocality: "Johor Bahru" with areaServed including Singapore). Cross-border queries like "GEO consultant near Singapore" can drive high-value leads.',
    myStat: 'Cross-border JB-Singapore professional service searches have grown significantly as remote work and Johor Premium Outlets draw Singapore business interest.',
  },
  {
    step: 'Implement Malaysian Business Schema',
    detail: 'Your Organization or Person schema should include: addressLocality: "Johor Bahru", addressCountry: "MY", areaServed with Malaysia, Singapore, and Philippines entries, and a contactPoint with a Malaysian phone number (+60 prefix). AI systems use geographic schema to determine which businesses to surface for location-based queries — "GEO consultant in Malaysia" will only resolve to your business if your schema clearly establishes Malaysian presence.',
    myStat: 'Geographic schema is the primary signal AI systems use to match location-based queries to businesses.',
  },
  {
    step: 'Build Malaysian Professional Brand Mentions',
    detail: 'Create profiles on: Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) partner networks, MaGIC (Malaysian Global Innovation & Creativity Centre) listings, Malaysian Chamber of Commerce directories, LinkedIn with explicit "Malaysia" location (for retrieval by AI systems browsing LinkedIn), and local industry association memberships. Each mention reinforces your Malaysian professional entity in AI training data.',
    myStat: 'Malaysia-based AI searches cross-reference brand mentions from Malaysian authoritative sources — similar to how Google uses local citation signals for local SEO.',
  },
  {
    step: 'Create Malaysia-Specific Content Assets',
    detail: 'Write content that specifically addresses Malaysian business context: "GEO for Malaysian SMEs," "AI automation for Malaysian manufacturers," "How Malaysian businesses can get cited in ChatGPT." Country-specific content is highly citable for geo-targeted AI queries. It also builds topical authority in the Malaysian market — a cluster of Malaysia-specific articles signals to AI models that your site is the authoritative Malaysian resource on your topic.',
    myStat: 'Country-specific content pages receive 2–4x higher citation rates for geo-targeted queries compared to generic content.',
