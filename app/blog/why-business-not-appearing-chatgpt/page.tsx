              <p>
                You type your business name into ChatGPT. Nothing. You ask &quot;best [your service] in [your city]&quot; — and your competitors get mentioned, but not you. It feels arbitrary, but it isn&apos;t.

                AI platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini don&apos;t discover businesses the way Google does. They rely on a combination of training data, real-time web retrieval, and content quality signals that most businesses have never optimized for. The result: technically excellent businesses with great Google rankings are completely absent from AI recommendations.
